<h1>Eminem – Rap God lyrics</h1>
<p>Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings</p>
<p>But I'm only going to get this one chance</p>
<p>Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)</p>
<p>Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what</p>
<p>If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble,</p>
<p>And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances</p>
<p>You were just what the doctor ordered</p>
<br>
<p>I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God</p>
<p>All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod</p>
<p>Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?</p>
<p>They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot</p>
<br>
<p>But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes</p>
<p>I got a laptop in my back pocket</p>
<p>My pen'll go off when I half-cock it</p>
<p>Got a fat knot from that rap profit</p>
<p>Made a living and a killing off it</p>
<p>Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office</p>
<p>With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack</p>
<p>I'm an MC still as honest</p>
<p>But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with)</p>
<p>This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop</p>
<p>You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy brat</p>
<p>Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac, backpack rap crap, yep, yackidy-yac</p>
<p>And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing</p>
<p>That I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table</p>
<p>Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half</p>
<p>Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact</p>
<p>How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack</p>
<p>Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a Maxipad</p>
<p>It's actually disastrously bad</p>
<p>For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as</p>
<br>
<p>I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God</p>
<p>All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod</p>
<p>Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?</p>
<p>Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard</p>
<br>
<p>Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got</p>
<p>Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance</p>
<p>Everybody loves to root for a nuisance</p>
<p>Hit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since</p>
<p>MC's get taken to school with this music</p>
<p>'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme</p>
<p>Now I lead a new school full of students</p>
<p>Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-</p>
<p>-W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim</p>
<p>Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position</p>
<p>To meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'</p>
<p>Roll Hall of Fame</p>
<p>Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames</p>
<p>Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame</p>
<p>On the wall of shame</p>
<p>You fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames</p>
<p>Off of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?</p>
<p>Little gay looking boy</p>
<p>So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy</p>
<p>You witnessing a mass occur</p>
<p>Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy</p>
<p>Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy</p>
<p>You get a thumbs up, pat on the back</p>
<p>And a "way to go" from your label everyday looking boy</p>
<p>Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?</p>
<p>I got a "hell yeah" from Dre looking boy</p>
<p>I'mma work for everything I have</p>
<p>Never ask nobody for shit, get outta my face looking boy</p>
<p>Basically boy you're never gonna be capable</p>
<p>To keep up with the same pace looking boy</p>
<br>
<p>'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God</p>
<p>All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod</p>
<p>The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar</p>
<p>Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God</p>
<p>Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard</p>
<br>
<p>So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent</p>
<p>Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'</p>
<p>And I should not be woken</p>
<p>I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating</p>
<p>But I got your mom deep throating</p>
<p>I'm out my Ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle</p>
<p>I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil</p>
<p>It's me, my honesty's brutal</p>
<p>But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though</p>
<p>For good at least once in a while</p>
<p>So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle</p>
<p>Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times</p>
<p>But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned</p>
<p>Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime</p>
<p>I know there was a time where once I</p>
<p>Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind</p>
<p>So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine</p>
<p>Appeal with the skin color of mine</p>
<p>You get too big and here they come trying to</p>
<p>Censor you like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from the Mathers LP</p>
<p>One when I tried to say "I'll take seven kids from Columbine</p>
<p>Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine"</p>
<p>See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm</p>
<p>Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal</p>
<p>You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though</p>
<p>And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for</p>
<p>You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows</p>
<p>You write normal, fuck being normal</p>
<p>And I just bought a new Raygun from the future</p>
<p>Just to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad</p>
<p>'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad</p>
<p>Singin' to a man while they played piano</p>
<p>Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel</p>
<p>So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day</p>
<p>"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"</p>
<p>Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)</p>
<p>Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human</p>
<p>What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman</p>
<p>Innovative and I'm made of rubber</p>
<p>So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you</p>
<p>I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating</p>
<p>How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating</p>
<p>Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting</p>
<p>For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating</p>
<p>'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated</p>
<p>I make elevating music, you make elevator music</p>
<p>Oh, he's too mainstream</p>
<p>Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it</p>
<p>It's not hip hop, it's pop, 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it</p>
<p>With rock, shock rap with Doc</p>
<p>Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it</p>
<p>I don't know how to make songs like that</p>
<p>I don't know what words to use</p>
<p>Let me know when it occurs to you</p>
<p>While I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you</p>
<p>It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you</p>
<p>How many verses I gotta murder to</p>
<p>Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!</p>
<p>School flunkie, pill junky</p>
<p>But look at the accolades the skills brung me</p>
<p>Full of myself, but still hungry</p>
<p>I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to</p>
<p>And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues</p>
<p>But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you</p>
<p>I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat</p>
<p>Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky</p>
<p>But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling</p>
<p>Angels fight with devils and, here's what they want from me</p>
<p>They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate</p>
<p>But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have</p>
<p>Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation</p>
<p>And understand the discrimination</p>
<p>But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then</p>
<p>But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?</p>
<p>Don't mistake it for Satan</p>
<p>It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas</p>
<p>And take a vacation to trip a broad</p>
<p>And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard</p>
<p>Be a king? Think not, why be a king when you can be a God?</p>
